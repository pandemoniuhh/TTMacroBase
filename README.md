#### An open source set of macros originally intended for private use, now publicly available for educational purposes.

 Use these macros at your own risk. I take no responsibility for anything that happens to your account, nor do I condone using these macros to gain an unfair advantage over other players, as outlined in the game's rules/terms of service.

All macros were written by myself and take full credit for them.
